 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2012, Goodyear&#146;s Supplier Code of Conduct was updated to include the following provision with
respect to conflict minerals: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Suppliers shall source minerals, derivatives of minerals, and other raw materials in a manner that respects human
rights. Suppliers shall avoid directly or indirectly financing or benefiting armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and/or its adjoining countries. Suppliers are required, from time to time, to certify that all materials and products
supplied to Goodyear either: i) do not contain tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold or ii) if they do contain those elements, Suppliers shall cooperate with Goodyear in determining the country of origin and the source (including the applicable smelter)
and chain of custody of those elements.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All suppliers of components that contain conflict minerals are required to agree to the Supplier Code of
Conduct in order to do business with us, and we reserve the right to terminate our business relationship with any supplier found not to be in compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct is specifically incorporated
into the terms and conditions of our North American purchase orders and is in the process of being incorporated into purchase orders globally. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order
to increase awareness of conflict minerals issues, we developed internal and external communications aimed at (1)&nbsp;sourcing raw materials and components in a manner that respects human rights, (2)&nbsp;identifying conflict minerals in our
products, (3)&nbsp;collecting information with respect to the country of origin, source and chain of custody of conflict minerals, and (4)&nbsp;responding appropriately to inquiries from our customers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any associate, supplier or customer may choose to report a policy violation, including a violation of our Supplier Code of Conduct, or raise a question
through the Goodyear Integrity Hotline, which is run by an independent service. Reports of policy violations may be made anonymously. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Identification
and Assessment of Risks in the Supply Chain</U> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We sent the EICC-GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (each a &#147;Template&#148; and collectively
the &#147;Templates&#148;) to each of the suppliers that directly supply us with components that contain conflict minerals in order to collect product-level information on all of the smelters in their supply chain, as well as the country of origin,
source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals. Once we received a completed Template from a supplier, we evaluated the Template for completeness and accuracy, and made further inquiries of our suppliers in order to clarify or improve the
quality of their responses to us. Our objective was to identify each of the smelters that placed conflict minerals into our supply chain, which we believed would facilitate our ability to identify the source and chain of custody of the conflict
minerals contained in our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2014, we became a member of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (&#147;CFSI&#148;), an industry initiative that
audits smelters&#146; and refiners&#146; due diligence activities, in order to satisfy several of the recommendations outlined in the OECD Guidance. Through our membership in the CFSI, we reviewed information provided by the Conflict-Free Smelter
Program of the CFSI to assist us </P>

in determining whether a smelter was sourcing conflict minerals in a socially responsible manner. If a smelter was included on the Compliant Smelter List maintained by the CFSI, we determined
that we would rely on the results of that third party audit for purposes of (1)&nbsp;the risk assessment with respect to the conflict minerals supply chain and (2)&nbsp;the evaluation of whether the smelter has effective due diligence practices.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also reviewed representations made by certain smelters, reviewed our suppliers&#146; and the smelters&#146; websites and conducted open-source
internet searches for any further information on our suppliers and the smelters regarding the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals they used, including information with respect to the mine or location of origin of the ore processed
by the smelters. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Design and Implementation of a Strategy to Respond to Identified Risks</U> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2014, we established a more formal process by which we will assist suppliers in complying with their conflict minerals reporting obligations to us and will
decide whether to continue doing business with suppliers who are unwilling or unable to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires suppliers to &#147;source minerals, derivatives of minerals, and other raw materials in a manner that
respects human rights&#148; and to &#147;avoid directly or indirectly financing or benefiting armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and/or its adjoining countries.&#148; We reserve the right to terminate our business relationship
with any supplier found not to be in compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct. We are not currently aware of any supplier who has breached this provision of our Supplier Code of Conduct and, therefore, no corrective action has been required.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For calendar year 2014, we relied on independent third party audits of a smelter&#146;s due diligence of its conflict minerals supply chain that were conducted
by the CFSI. In the future we intend to rely on such audits that are conducted by the CFSI or other similar industry initiatives or by governments. </P>

extent required by Section&nbsp;13(p) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13p-1 thereunder, we will annually provide a Conflict Minerals Report as an exhibit to Form SD that describes our due diligence practices with respect to conflict
minerals that we know or have reason to believe may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the &#147;Covered Countries&#148;), including with respect to our management systems, risk assessment
and risk management activities. We will also provide an independent private sector audit of our Conflict Minerals Report to the extent required by law. </P>

a total of 14 direct suppliers of the necessary components of our products that contain conflict minerals. We received Templates that we deemed to be complete, or acceptable representation letters as to country of origin, from all of those
suppliers. </P>
