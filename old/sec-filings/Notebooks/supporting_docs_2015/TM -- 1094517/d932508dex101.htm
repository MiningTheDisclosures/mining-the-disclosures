This Rule was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to conflict minerals as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Rule
imposes certain reporting obligations on SEC registrants whose manufactured products contain tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (&#147;3TG,&#148; also defined by Form SD as &#147;conflict minerals&#148;), and who have a reason to believe that the
products they manufacture, or contract to manufacture, contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of those products. If the SEC registrant has a reason to believe that any of those conflict minerals may have
originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (&#147;DRC&#148;) or an adjoining country (together with the DRC, the &#147;Covered Countries&#148;), or is unable to determine the country of origin of those conflict minerals, the SEC registrant
is required to submit a Conflict Minerals Report to the SEC that includes a description of the measures it took to exercise due diligence on the conflict minerals&#146; source and chain of custody. </P>

realize such procurement and usage, we conduct inquiries tracing back through our supply chains and confirm if conflict minerals are used. In addition, we take appropriate steps to discontinue procurement of materials that can cause social problems
or finance armed groups, if such usage is detected. Based on mutually beneficial relationships, we ask our suppliers to understand our policies and approaches and to promote responsible material procurement. </P>

for conflict minerals and CSR guidelines for business partners and communicated them to both internal and external parties. We have reinforced structure of the conflict minerals team within the organization, which was originally established in 2011
to lead the due diligence on the origin of conflict minerals and chain of custody, by assigning additional members from engineering department. We also held sessions for suppliers as part of awareness-raising activities and explained the outline of
the RCOI survey, including background and objectives. Further, we have streamlined the conflict minerals-related communication flow with relevant departments including overseas subsidiaries. It is designed that all the inquiries we receive from
outside parties are raised to the conflict minerals team and discussed among the members of the team. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

overseas subsidiaries, carried out the RCOI survey across the borders, pursuant to the discussions among management on Toyota&#146;s Policies and Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues and measures relating to the RCOI survey. We have been using the
Conflict Minerals Reporting Template published by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (&#147;CFSI&#148;) and compared the results of the survey on smelter information with the list of Conflict-Free Smelter Program (&#147;CFSP&#148;). As we have
been closely communicating with major Tier-1 suppliers, some of the feedbacks we receive from them were integrated into the conflict minerals survey-related materials, such as survey manuals, FAQs and other tools. Those materials are provided to
suppliers for free of charge, with the aim to provide support on the RCOI survey. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

cooperation through automotive industry organizations such as the Automotive Industry Action Group (&#147;AIAG&#148;) and the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association (&#147;JAPIA&#148;), and maintained regular communication including exchange of
opinions. Through AIAG, we supported and contributed to CFSI activities. We have been an active member of the Japan Conflict Free Sourcing Working Group, which was established with other companies from the automotive industry and the electronics
industry to collaborate with the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and cooperate on smelters&#146; survey activities. We have visited some 3TG industry organizations through the Japan Conflict Free Sourcing Working Group. We also
