(the &#147;Rule&#148;) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for the reporting period January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Rule requires disclosure of certain information when a company manufactures or contracts to manufacture products and the minerals specified in the Rule
are necessary to the functionality or production of those products. The specified minerals, which we collectively refer to in this Report as the &#147;Conflict Minerals,&#148; are gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolframite,
including their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten. The &#147;Covered Countries&#148; for the purposes of the Rule and this Report are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African
Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Description of the Company&#146;s Products Covered by this Report

were manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;for which the manufacture was completed during calendar year 2014. These products, which are referred to in this Report collectively as the &#147;Covered
Products,&#148; consist of professional, medical, industrial and commercial products serving the test&nbsp;&amp; measurement, environmental, life sciences&nbsp;and diagnostics, dental and industrial technologies business segments. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Overview </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has conducted a reasonable country
of origin inquiry regarding the Conflict Minerals. This inquiry was reasonably designed to determine whether any of the Conflict Minerals originated in the Covered Countries and whether any of the Conflict Minerals may be from recycled or scrap
sources. The Company&#146;s reasonable country of origin inquiry was part of its due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the Conflict Minerals. Based on this reasonable country of origin inquiry, the Company has reason to believe that
certain of its necessary Conflict Minerals may have originated in the Covered Countries and are not from recycled or scrap sources. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Design of Due
Diligence Process </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the Conflict Minerals, including its efforts to determine the
countries of origin of the Conflict Minerals, was designed to conform to the framework in the <I>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High
Risk Areas: Second Edition</I>, including the related supplements on gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten (the &#147;OECD Guidance&#148;), and is described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Policy </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company adopted a policy related to the
Conflict Minerals (the &#147;Company Policy&#148;), incorporating the standards set forth in the OECD Guidance. The policy states the Company&#146;s commitment to sourcing components and materials from companies that share its values regarding
respect for human rights, integrity and environmental responsibility and complying with the OECD Guidance and Section&nbsp;1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and requires the Company&#146;s suppliers to be or become &#147;conflict-free&#148; and source
only from conflict-free smelters. Under the policy, each Company supplier is </P>

required to provide completed Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (&#147;CFSI&#148;) Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (the &#147;Template&#148;) declarations evidencing such supplier&#146;s
commitment to becoming conflict-free and documenting countries of origin for the Conflict Minerals that it purchases. This policy is available at <U>www.danaher.com</U> under the heading &#147;Investors&#148; and &#147;Corporate Governance.&#148;

implemented an internal management structure to execute the reasonable country of origin inquiry and due diligence process. The structure consists of a member of Company senior management with overall responsibility for the reasonable country of
origin inquiry and the due diligence process; a member of the Company&#146;s corporate procurement department with dedicated responsibility for the design and execution of the reasonable country of origin inquiry and due diligence process; and an
appointed employee at each of the Company&#146;s operating companies with responsibility for discharging the operating company&#146;s responsibilities in connection with the reasonable country of origin inquiry and due diligence process. The Company
has also implemented a Company-level grievance mechanism (described in the Company Policy) to allow interested parties to voice concerns or reports of possible violations of the Company Policy </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Due Diligence Process </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s supply chain
with respect to the Covered Products is complex, and there are many third parties in the supply chain between the ultimate manufacturer of the Covered Products and the original sources of Conflict Minerals. In this regard, the Company does not
purchase Conflict Minerals directly from mines, smelters or refiners. The Company must therefore rely on its suppliers to provide information regarding the origin of Conflict Minerals that are included in the Covered Products. Moreover, the Company
believes that the smelters and other refiners (&#147;smelters&#148;) of the Conflict Minerals are best situated to identify the sources of Conflict Minerals, and therefore has structured its due diligence process to ultimately identify the
applicable smelters of Conflict Minerals in the Company&#146;s supply chain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company designed its due diligence process to encompass the suppliers
(&#147;suppliers&#148;) that provided to the Company components and materials that may contain Conflict Minerals necessary to the functionality or production of products that the Company manufactured or contracted to manufacture and for which the
manufacture was completed during calendar year 2014. The Company determined the suppliers in scope by obtaining from each of its operating companies a list of the operating company&#146;s suppliers, classified into three groups based on the nature
of the components and materials supplied: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Company&#146;s annual spend exceeded a de minimis threshold. The number of suppliers included in the scope of the inquiry exceeded 10,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company
contacted each supplier in scope and requested the name and contact details for the person responsible for the supplier&#146;s Conflict Minerals compliance. The Company then emailed to each such supplier contact a copy of the Company Policy and a
link to the Template and requested that such supplier return to the Company a completed Template with respect to all components and materials that such supplier provides to the Company. The Company followed up with the suppliers that did not respond
to the Company&#146;s initial outreach, and also followed up with suppliers who submitted data that appeared to be incomplete or incorrect. As necessary, the Company also educated suppliers regarding the reasons for requesting the Conflict Minerals
data and answered supplier questions relating thereto. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In many cases, suppliers were unable to identify the smelters or countries of origin in their supply chain, while other suppliers responded by providing
information related to all of the items the supplier produces without identifying smelters specific to the items purchased by the Company. While the Company compiled a list of the smelters that were identified in the responses provided by the
suppliers, and reviewed publicly available information (including the CFSI website) for information regarding the Conflict Minerals sourcing practices of the identified smelters, based on the information received from the Company&#146;s suppliers
the Company is unable to connect specific smelters to its product categories for 2014. Therefore, the Company is unable to disclose the facilities that processed the Conflict Minerals or identify the countries of origin or mines or location of
origin of the Conflict Minerals contained in specific products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Risk Mitigation and Due Diligence Improvement </I></P>
