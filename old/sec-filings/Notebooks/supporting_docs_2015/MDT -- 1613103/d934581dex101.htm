2014 (the &#147;Reporting Period&#148;) pursuant to Rule 13p-1 and Form SD (the &#147;Rule&#148;) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Conflict Minerals are defined as cassiterite, columbite-tantalite (coltan), gold,
wolframite, or their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten and gold (3TG)&nbsp;for the purposes of this assessment. The &#147;Covered Countries&#148; for the purposes of the Rule are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the

registrant must exercise due diligence on the conflict minerals&#146; source and chain of custody and submit a Conflict Minerals Report to the SEC that includes a description of those due diligence measures. </P>

products. In order to conform to the Rule, Medtronic performed a risk based assessment to determine if the necessary conflict minerals in the products Medtronic manufactured or contracted to manufacture directly or indirectly financed or benefitted
armed groups in one or more of the Covered Countries. Medtronic identified suppliers to survey by reviewing 2014 direct material purchases and applying applicability filters to segment suppliers that supply Medtronic with products or components that
may contain necessary conflict minerals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Company Overview </B></P>

as cassiterite, columbite-tantalite (coltan), gold, wolframite, or their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten and gold (3TG)&nbsp;for the purposes of this assessment. The &#147;Covered Countries&#148; for the purposes of the
