in products we manufacture or contract to manufacture. Our diligence measures were designed to adhere, in all material respects, with the internationally-recognized due diligence framework in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply
Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and the related Supplement on Tin, Tantalum and Tungsten and the Gold Supplement (Second Edition OECD 2013) (the &#147;OECD Framework&#148;). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Our position in the supply chain is as a remote downstream purchaser, several levels removed from the actual mining of the Conflict Minerals. We do not make purchases of raw ore or unrefined
Conflict Minerals from the Covered Countries and we do not source any products or components directly from the Covered Countries. In light of our remote position in the supply chain, we must rely upon our suppliers (and their multiple sub-suppliers
and intermediaries) for information on and verification of the chain of custody of Conflict Minerals contained in our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>Due Diligence
Process </U></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After conducting a &#147;reasonable country of origin inquiry&#148; (&#147;RCOI&#148;) in accordance with the instructions to
Item&nbsp;1.01 of Form SD (and as disclosed in our Report on Form SD for the 2014 Reporting Period), because 6% of suppliers have not responded to our supply chain survey (described below) or our repeated attempts to follow-up and secure their
cooperation, the Company was unable to conclude definitively, based solely on the Company&#146;s RCOI evaluation, that none of the Conflict Minerals in its products that were not sourced from recycled or scrap materials did not originate in the
Covered Countries. The Company subsequently conducted due diligence to ascertain the source of origin of the Conflict Minerals in its products and, in particular, to determine if any of such minerals were sourced from the Covered Countries and
directly or indirectly contributed to or financed conflict in that region. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Conformity with OECD Framework</U>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with Rule 13p-1, we designed our Conflict Mineral Compliance Program to conform, in all material respects, with the five-step process outlined in
the OECD Framework. In addition, our diligence measures relied upon information and templates obtained from the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and Global e-Sustainability (&#147;EICC/GeSI&#148;) Initiative relating to Conflict Minerals,
including the Conflict Free Smelter Program (&#147;CFSI&#148;). The five-step process identified within the OECD Framework includes: (1)&nbsp;establishing strong company management systems; (2)&nbsp;identifying and assessing supply chain risk;
(3)&nbsp;designing and implementing a risk response strategy; (4)&nbsp;third party auditing of our due diligence practices; and (5)&nbsp;reporting annually on supply chain due diligence. This Conflict Minerals Report outlines the measures taken by
us in accordance with the OECD Framework during the reporting period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our Compliance Program, Jarden adopted a Conflict Minerals Policy (the
&#147;Policy&#148;) and Code of Conduct. A copy of our Policy and Code of Conduct can be found on our website at <U>www.jarden.com/suppliers</U>. Our Form SD and this Conflict Minerals Report can be found on our web site at
<U>http://www.jarden.com/for-investors/sec-filings</U>. The content of our website as referred to herein is included for general information only and is not incorporated by reference into this Conflict Minerals Report or our Form&nbsp;SD. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Risk Assessment</U>. Our various business units rely on their direct suppliers to provide information on the origin of the Conflict
Minerals contained in components and materials supplied to them. During the 2014 Reporting Period, each of our business units reviewed their products to determine which may contain Conflict Minerals. As a result of that review, a supply-chain survey
was conducted using the EICC/GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (Template). Questionnaires were sent to 480 suppliers and we received valid responses from 94%. With one exception, those responses indicated that the Conflict Minerals in the
supplied components or parts did not originate in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries (the &#147;Covered Countries&#148;). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Six percent of the suppliers have not responded to our questionnaire or our repeated attempts to follow-up and
secure their cooperation. We are continuing our efforts to obtain executed questionnaires from this small percentage of non-responsive suppliers. Nonetheless, on the basis of the information we have obtained through our general work with such
non-responsive suppliers and publicly available sources, we have no reason to believe that the Conflict Minerals in the components supplied by such suppliers originated in the Covered Countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One respondent reported that the material (tin solder) supplied for use in antennas manufactured by Jarden was sourced from non-conflict areas of a Conflict
Country by a certified conflict-free smelter (Malaysia Smelting Corporation). According to CSFI, the smelter is presently in the re-audit process. We understand that this respondent is part of a SEC reporting company and, to our knowledge, has a
robust Conflict Minerals program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Control Systems</U>. As noted above, Jarden adopted a Policy and Code of Conduct through which we
manage our supply chain risk identification and assessment processes, as well as engage with our suppliers and manufacturers to mitigate the risk that any Conflict Minerals contained in our products are sourced from mines or smelters in the Covered
Countries that directly or indirectly benefit or finance armed groups in that region. In particular, we are continuing to audit our suppliers and have sought their cooperation and assistance in ensuring that Conflict Minerals used in our products
are sourced reliably and responsibly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our success in making determinations about the potential presence of Conflict Minerals in our products depends upon
various factors including, but not limited to, the respective due diligence efforts of our suppliers and their supply chain and their respective willingness, whether public or private entities, to disclose such information to us, and the ability of
the involved entities in making their determinations in accordance with nationally or internationally recognized standards, including the OECD Guidance. The failure to obtain reliable information from any level of our supply chain could have a
material impact on our future ability to report on the presence of Conflict Minerals with any degree of certainty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Risk Mitigation in
2015</U>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During calendar year 2015, Jarden intends to conduct further follow-up with the remaining 6% of its suppliers that, to date, have been
non-responsive to our information requests. In addition, we will continue our diligence to attempt to ascertain the source of origin of minerals used by those smelters and refiners identified by our suppliers. However, given our remote position in
the supply chain, we are reliant upon the cooperation of our manufacturers and suppliers. There can be no assurance that our manufacturers or suppliers will continue to cooperate with our information inquiries and requests for certifications or
provide documentation or other evidence we consider reliable or in a time frame sufficient to allow us to make our own reasonable determination and comply with our reporting requirements under Rule 13p-1. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continue to support independent third-party audits of smelters and refiners through the CSFI or other
third-party certification schemes. We will also continue our efforts through relevant trade associations to assist in the definition and improvement of best practices and enhancing supply chain leverage. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Conclusion</U>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because 6% of suppliers have
not responded to our supply chain questionnaire or our repeated attempts to follow-up and secure their cooperation, we are not able to determine conclusively, based solely on the Company&#146;s RCOI evaluation, the ultimate origin of a small
percentage of the Conflict Minerals contained in certain of our products to definitively ensure that the suppliers do not directly or indirectly benefit or finance armed groups in the Covered Countries. Nonetheless, we have found no basis for
concluding, based upon the information we have obtained to date, that any of the Conflict Minerals contained in our products directly or indirectly benefit or finance armed groups in the region. However, we are continuing our efforts to obtain
definitive information from this small percentage of non-responsive suppliers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>Independent Third Party Audit</U></B>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with the SEC Statement, and as otherwise allowed under Rule 13p-1, this Report has not been subject to an independent private sector audit. </P>
