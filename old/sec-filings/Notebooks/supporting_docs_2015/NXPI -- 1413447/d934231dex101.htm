for the reporting period from January&nbsp;1 to December&nbsp;31, 2014. Rule 13p-1 was adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) to implement disclosure and reporting requirements pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). The report presented herein is not audited. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This CMR relates to the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Introduction </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NXP believes taking responsibility for its impact on the world is crucial to the company&#146;s success and its ability to deliver value to customers, partners
and employees, as well as protecting the environment for future generations. Therefore we have clear goals in corporate governance, people practices, product development and manufacturing, environment and community responsibility. Whether it&#146;s
people management, supplier relationships or product design, NXP has developed a set of auditable standards on social responsibility, which have been deployed through extensive training programs in all our sites. Our ambition for our worldwide
operation is to go beyond compliance, and establish a global benchmark. NXP is dedicated to ensuring ethical sourcing, and has made significant progress toward using only conflict-free minerals in its products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have a very broad product portfolio of semiconductor products and a multi-tier supply chain that is both global and complex. Our supply chain ranges from
small business suppliers to large enterprises and international corporations. For this reason, we rely upon our direct suppliers to provide information with respect to the origin of the conflict minerals contained in components and materials
supplied to us, including sources of Conflict Minerals that are supplied to them from lower tier suppliers. In almost all cases, the information relating to the Conflict Minerals contained in our products is derived from lower tier suppliers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based upon our analysis of the range of the product solutions that we manufacture or contract to manufacture, we have determined that many of our products
contain gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten. For the reporting period from January&nbsp;1 to December&nbsp;31, 2014, following the due diligence that we performed, as described below, we were not able to obtain adequate information from our supply
chain to make a determination as to the source of all of the Conflict Minerals that we use. Therefore, we found our products to be DRC conflict undeterminable. For that reason, we are required under Rule 13p-1 to submit to the SEC this CMR as an
exhibit to Form SD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of
Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, Second Edition (the &#147;OECD Guidance&#148;) and Rule 13p-1, this report is available on our website on www.nxp.com under About NXP, Corporate Social Responsibility, Conflict Minerals. We
already adopted a conflict minerals free policy in 2010. The latest version of our conflict minerals free policy can be found on our company website www.nxp.com under About NXP, Corporate Social Responsibility. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the reporting period from January&nbsp;1 to December&nbsp;31, 2014, we conducted due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the Conflict Minerals

that could contain Conflict Minerals subject to Rule 13p-1. These suppliers and contract manufacturers were spread over a total of more than 350 locations worldwide. Determination of the suppliers and contract manufacturers in scope of our due
diligence process was done via selecting relevant material and product groups and we cross checked this information with known suppliers and contract manufacturers of gold, tin, tantalum and/or tungsten containing materials or products from our
material content databases to make sure all relevant suppliers and contract manufacturers were included in the scope. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We surveyed suppliers and contract
manufacturers using the CFSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (&#147;CMRT&#148;). We have adopted the CFSI &#147;Conflict Mineral Free Smelter Program&#148; as our compliance standard for upstream due diligence. Since 2012, we actively engaged
with applicable suppliers and contract manufacturers to educate them on the requirements and importance of this program. In 2013 and 2014, we sought declarations from these suppliers and contract manufacturers using the CFSI CMRT. In the first
quarter of 2015, we asked the applicable suppliers and contract manufacturers to submit any updated declarations over the reporting period. We record and store all responses from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All 237 supplier and contract manufacturer locations surveyed responded to our inquiries. All supplier and contract manufacturer locations submitted a

completeness and validated against list of known smelters and refiners such as the lists that are regularly published by the CFSI. Where necessary, we followed up with suppliers and contract manufacturers to complete the survey responses and/or to
determine whether sources listed in the responses were correct. In a few cases, listed smelters, refiners or recyclers were contacted directly to seek further clarification. In addition, we measured the implementation of conflict-free minerals
requirements by our suppliers and contract manufacturers through supplier performance management programs. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The world&#146;s leading semiconductor industry associations, consisting of the Semiconductor Industry
Associations in China, Taiwan, Europe, Japan, Korea and the United States meet annually as the World Semiconductor Council (&#147;WSC&#148;) to bring together industry leaders to address issues of global concern to the semiconductor industry. In
2013, the WSC adopted a Conflict-Free Supply Chain Policy (www.semiconductorcouncil.org). The Conflict Minerals team of the WSC is currently chaired by NXP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2014 NXP became a member of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (the &#147;CFSI&#148;) and has been participating in several meetings and programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NXP will continue to actively collaborate with industry peers on responsible sourcing in the coming years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NXP requires all of its suppliers to adhere to its Conflict Minerals requirements. As we enter into new contracts with, or our contracts renew with our
suppliers or contract manufacturers, we add a clause, which is already part of our current standard terms and conditions of purchase and our NXP Supplier Code of Conduct, requiring suppliers to provide sourcing and smelter information with regard to
conflict minerals and to implement policies and due diligence measures in accordance with these requirements. If a supplier fails to comply with NXP&#146;s Conflict Minerals requirements, NXP may take measures up to and including termination of its
relationship with the supplier. In addition, we will continue to seek to completely and accurately identify our smelters and mining sources and will advocate to our suppliers and contract manufacturers to seek CFSI certification on the smelters in
their supply chain. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After conducting due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals subject to Rule 13p-1 in our products, we found our products to be
DRC conflict undeterminable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We manufacture or contract to manufacture a large number different &#147;High Performance Mixed Signal&#148; and
&#147;Standard Product&#148; product solutions that are used in a wide range of applications, such as automotive, identification, wireless infrastructure, lighting, industrial, mobile, consumer and computing. Most of these products contain gold
and/or tin. A smaller, but still significant number of products also contain tantalum and/or tungsten. For the same product, gold, tin, tungsten or tantalum can come from different suppliers or contract manufacturers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our previous CMR for the reporting year 2013 we stated that all tantalum smelters known to be in our supply chain had been designated Conflict Free, and
that remained the case throughout the year 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, since several of our suppliers and contract manufacturers reported gold, tin and tungsten
smelters that have not yet been certified as Conflict Free, we are, at this point, not able to make a comprehensive determination on the source of these Conflict Minerals and whether these may finance or otherwise benefit armed groups in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo or any of its adjoining countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of the 151 smelters and refiners of Conflict Minerals identified for calendar year
2014, at least 17 smelters and refiners were identified as sources of Conflict Minerals from the DRC or adjoining countries. All of these 17 smelters were determined as Conflict Free and verified as compliant with the Conflict-Free Smelter Program
(CFSP) assessment protocol. There may be additional, mostly gold, smelters that source from the DRC or adjoining countries as not all smelters have disclosed their sources. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, it is possible that supplier or contract manufacturer responses are inaccurate, unreliable and/or incomplete. Suppliers and contract
manufacturers often report at a company level which means they submit a consolidated report for all of their products and materials, not just products and materials provided to NXP and within the scope of Rule 13p-1. </P>
