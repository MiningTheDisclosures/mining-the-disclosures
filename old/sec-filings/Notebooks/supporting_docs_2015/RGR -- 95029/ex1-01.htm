<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">This is the Conflict Minerals Report of Sturm, Ruger &amp;
Company, Inc. (&ldquo;Ruger&rdquo;) for calendar year 2014 (&ldquo;Reporting Period&rdquo;) in accordance with Rule 13p-1 (&ldquo;Rule
13p-1&rdquo;) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 13p-1 and Form SD require the disclosure of certain information if
a company manufactures or contracts to manufacture products for which certain &ldquo;Conflict Minerals&rdquo; (as defined below)
are present in the products and necessary to the functionality of such products. &ldquo;Conflict Minerals&rdquo; are defined as
cassiterite, wolframite, columbite-tantalite, gold and their derivatives, which are tin, tungsten and tantalum (&ldquo;3TG&rdquo;)
mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the adjoining countries (&ldquo;Covered Countries&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">This report has been prepared by management of Ruger. The
information includes the activities of all divisions, which we are required to consolidate. Ruger is one of the nation&rsquo;s
leading manufacturers of rugged, reliable firearms for the commercial sporting market. The only full-line manufacturer of American-made
firearms, Ruger offers consumers over 400 variations of more than 30 product lines. For more than 60 years, Ruger has been a model
of corporate and community responsibility. Our motto, &ldquo;Arms Makers for Responsible Citizens,&rdquo; echoes the importance
of these principles as we work hard to deliver quality and innovative firearms. Ruger has been in business since 1949 and was incorporated
in its present form under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1969. Ruger&rsquo;s principal executive office is located in Southport,
CT, and its manufacturing facilities are located in Mayodan, NC, Newport, NH, and Prescott, AZ.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">In accordance with Rule 13p-1, Ruger conducted a Reasonable
Country of Origin Inquiry (&ldquo;RCOI&rdquo;) for 3TG contained within its products, and conducted due diligence to determine
the Conflict Minerals status of the necessary parts and raw materials used in its firearms manufacturing business. Ruger&rsquo;s
RCOI and due diligence processes and efforts were developed in accordance with the 2nd edition of The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (&ldquo;OECD&rdquo;) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected
and High-Risk Areas (&ldquo;OECD Guidance&rdquo;), an internationally recognized due diligence framework. Ruger designed its due
diligence process to conform in all material respects with the OECD Guidance framework.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">Ruger conducted a good faith RCOI relating to 3TG contained
within its products. This good faith RCOI was designed to determine whether any 3TG used in Ruger products originate in the Covered
Countries and/or whether any 3TG contained within Ruger products comes from recycled or scrap sources.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">As a company in the firearms manufacturing business, Ruger
is several levels removed from the actual mining of 3TG. As a result, Ruger relies upon its direct suppliers and publicly available
data about them to obtain information regarding the origin of any 3TG that is contained within Ruger&rsquo;s products, including
where possible, the smelters of the 3TG. Similarly, many of Ruger&rsquo;s suppliers depend on their suppliers for this information.
Ruger&rsquo;s response is limited by its ability to obtain accurate information regarding the source of 3TG from its suppliers.
Ruger does not purchase raw ore or unrefined 3TG and makes no purchases in the Covered Countries.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">As the first step in the good faith RCOI, Ruger worked
to identify suppliers which were potentially providing materials and components that contain 3TG. This list was refined during
2014, and Ruger sent letters to each identified supplier that: (i) described the reporting obligations imposed by Section 1502
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and (ii) requested information regarding the presence and sourcing
of 3TG used in the materials and components supplied to the Company during the Reporting Period. Suppliers were asked to provide
this information through the use of the most recent EICC/GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">Ruger developed an escalation process for suppliers who
were non-responsive to the initial request, or who provided responses which were unclear. Ruger engaged further with certain suppliers
relating to their responses to ensure that the request was understood and complied with. Ruger then compared the smelters and refiners
identified in the supply-chain survey against the list of smelter facilities which have been identified as Conflict Free by programs
such as the EICC/GeSI Conflict Free Smelter program for 3TG.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 10pt 0 0">In order to manage the scope of the task, Ruger relies
upon its suppliers to provide information on the origin of any 3TG contained in the parts or raw materials supplied to the Company.
Based upon these responses, Ruger has determined that 69.0% of its suppliers are DRC Conflict Free, and 21.1% are DRC conflict
undeterminable (because the suppliers were unable to confirm to Ruger the ultimate source of the 3TG). 9.9% of Ruger&rsquo;s suppliers
did not respond to Ruger&rsquo;s request. No supplier identified parts or raw materials supplied to Ruger as originating in the
Covered Counties. Therefore, Ruger has determined in good faith that for calendar year 2014, the substantial majority of its 3TG
used in its product is &ldquo;DRC Conflict Free,&rdquo; and a relatively small portion remains &ldquo;DRC conflict undeterminable.&rdquo;
The DRC conflict undeterminable 3TG is located in the metal components of Ruger&rsquo;s firearm products, which are manufactured
in its three manufacturing facilities. Ruger makes this determination due to a lack of information from some of its suppliers for
certain parts and raw materials used in the production of </P>

country of origin inquiry, Ruger continued to receive supply chain responses through May 20, 2015. In the next compliance period,
Ruger intends to obtain full reporting compliance from its suppliers and implement steps to gather additional information during
its due diligence to identify parts and raw materials that contain any Conflict Minerals.</P>
