&#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148;). As used herein, &#147;conflict minerals&#148; are columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold, wolframite and the derivatives tantalum, tin and tungsten, without regard to
the location of origin of the minerals or derivative metals. The &#147;Conflict Minerals Rule&#148; refers to Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Form SD. </P>

distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory, sportswear, occupational and performance apparel categories. VF&#146;s
centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for sourcing and delivering products to our customers. On an annual basis, VF sources or produces approximately 522&nbsp;million units spread across more than 30 brands. Our products are
obtained from 28 VF-operated manufacturing facilities (internally manufactured product) and approximately 2,000 contractor manufacturing facilities (sourced product) in over 50 countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not directly purchase conflict minerals from any source. VF has adopted a policy and related procedures, as described below in this Conflict Minerals
Report, focused on VF&#146;s commitment to sourcing components and materials from suppliers that share our ethical values and that support compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and regulations, including VF&#146;s
disclosure obligations related to conflict minerals. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

possibly in-scope for purposes of our compliance with the Conflict Minerals Rule based on our level of influence over the manufacturing process (in the case of products that we may have contracted to manufacture) and the potential use of conflict
minerals in the products. For sourced product, we reached out to all suppliers. For internally manufactured product, we reached out to those component suppliers that we determined may have provided us with components that contained conflict
minerals. In this Conflict Minerals Report, we refer to those suppliers that were included in our 2014 outreach as the &#147;Covered Suppliers.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
outreach included 881 Covered Suppliers. The responses that we received from our Covered Suppliers in respect to 2014 indicated that only a small portion of the Covered Suppliers supplied us with products or components that were in-scope for
purposes of our Conflict Minerals Rule compliance. Many VF products do not contain any conflict minerals and, for those that do, conflict minerals content generally represents a small amount of the total materials content of the product. For
example, conflict minerals may be found in items such as buttons, zippers, snaps and eyelets, although not all of these items are necessarily in-scope for purposes of our compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VF&#146;s &#147;reasonable country of origin inquiry&#148; (&#147;RCOI&#148;) process was designed to identify its manufactured (or contracted to be
manufactured) products that may contain necessary conflict minerals, and, if these are present, obtain transparency into the conflict minerals supply chain for such products, and, more generally, to achieve engagement from its suppliers concerning
responsible sourcing of conflict minerals. The specific goal of VF&#146;s RCOI was to determine whether the conflict minerals in its relevant products originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the
&#147;Covered Countries&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Conflict Minerals Rule, based on the results of our RCOI, we were required to conduct due diligence for
2014. These due diligence efforts are discussed below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our RCOI, to the extent applicable, we utilized the same processes and procedures as for our
due diligence. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our conflict minerals due diligence processes were based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (Second Edition 2013) (&#147;OECD Guidance&#148;), an internationally recognized due diligence framework. Our diligence measures were based on certain processes put in place for
the Company&#146;s RCOI and included the following. These are not all of the discrete steps that were part of our due diligence. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Establish Strong
Company Management Systems </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VF has established a management system, as described below, consisting of a framework of policies, procedures,
processes and organizational structure that supports our efforts to ensure that our products do not contain conflict minerals that support conflict in the Covered Countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>VF&#146;s Conflict Minerals Policy</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our conflict minerals policy (the &#147;Conflict Minerals Policy&#148;) indicates that VF expects all suppliers of our products and materials
to cooperate with our conflict minerals procedures. We further expect all suppliers to seek to purchase materials that contain conflict minerals from sources determined not to be involved in funding conflict in the Covered Countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our conflict minerals policy is publicly available on our website and is sent to relevant internal personnel and suppliers. </P>

management system responsible for managing our conflict minerals compliance program (the &#147;Program&#148;). We have a team of subject matter experts directly responsible for management of the Program with members from our supply chain and legal
departments. The team periodically reports on the progress of the Program to senior management and key internal stakeholders. VF has also enlisted a third party information management service provider (the &#147;Service Provider&#148;) to assist in
our due diligence activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Control Systems</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VF has policies that include, but are not limited to, our Code of Business Conduct, which outlines expected behaviors for all VF employees and
our Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement and Conflict Minerals Policy for our suppliers. VF is also in the process of incorporating conflict minerals compliance requirements into a number of contracts with its suppliers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (the &#147;CMRT&#148;) developed by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (the
&#147;CFSI&#148;) to collect information from suppliers. To provide better transparency within VF&#146;s supply chain and to facilitate communication of policies and expectations, the Service Provider conducts outreach and collects diligence results
through an online platform (the &#147;Online Platform&#148;). This information is retained for at least five years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Supplier
engagement and education</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VF&#146;s engagement with its Covered Suppliers consisted of multiple communications through email and
telephone to educate them on our expectations for sourcing conflict minerals and the requirements of the Conflict Minerals Rule. Covered Suppliers were provided various avenues to obtain additional information and guidance regarding our Program,
including an online supplier education portal, and contact email addresses and telephone numbers for obtaining answers to questions and/or receiving guidance on completing the information requests from VF. </P>

were sent to 881 Covered Suppliers. The Service Provider followed up by email or phone with all Covered Suppliers that did not respond to the request within a specified time frame. To the extent
that, after the foregoing efforts, a Covered Supplier did not provide the information requested, an escalation process was initiated. The escalation process consisted of direct outreach by our personnel to the Covered Supplier. Responses were
received from 89% of the Covered Suppliers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Service Provider reviewed the responses received from the Covered Suppliers based on its
internally-developed written review criteria for plausibility, consistency and gaps. As part of that review, if a Covered Supplier indicated that there were no conflict minerals in the products or materials that it supplied to us, the Service
Provider reviewed those responses for plausibility and Covered Suppliers were also given an opportunity to provide a certification of that determination. The Service Provider followed up by email or phone with the Covered Suppliers that submitted a
response that triggered specified quality control flags. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Service Provider reviewed the smelters and refiners identified by the Covered Suppliers
against those contained in its internal database. To the extent not in that database, it requested that the Covered Supplier confirm that the listed entity is a smelter or refiner. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to those completed responses that identified a smelter or refiner, the Service Provider also compared that information against the lists of
compliant and active, or the equivalent, smelters and refiners published by the CFSI, the London Bullion Market Association (&#147;LBMA&#148;) and the Responsible Jewellery Council (&#147;RJC&#148;). Twenty-nine of the smelters and refiners
identified by the Covered Suppliers as potentially having processed conflict minerals contained in our in-scope products were listed as compliant or the equivalent by an independent third-party as of April&nbsp;14, 2015 and two were listed as active
by the CFSI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to those smelters and refiners identified by a Covered Supplier that were not listed as compliant or the equivalent by an
independent third party, the Service Provider attempted to contact the smelter or refiner and/or consulted publicly available information to attempt to determine the minerals processed by the smelter or refiner, the country of origin, whether the
conflict minerals were from sources that directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed groups in a Covered Country and the smelter or refiner&#146;s due diligence measures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For those Covered Suppliers that did not provide information concerning the processors of conflict minerals in their supply chain, the Service Provider
requested information on the Covered Suppliers&#146; suppliers. These suppliers, and subsequent tiers of suppliers as identified to the Service Provider, were then contacted by the Service Provider. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Design and Implement a Strategy to Respond to Identified Risks </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">VF&#146;s implementation team provides periodic updates to senior management and key internal stakeholders on the progress of due diligence and supplier
responsiveness and any identified risks. We address any identified risks on a case-by-case basis. This flexible approach enables us to tailor the response to the risks identified. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To ensure suppliers understand and meet our expectations, we regularly communicate information and guidance regarding our Program through a number of
channels, including an online supplier education portal and direct communication from our sourcing hubs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Carry out Independent Third-party Audit of

Suppliers provide us with a completed CMRT and through the other procedures followed by us and the Service Provider that are described in this Conflict Minerals Report. VF does not have sufficient information to conclusively determine the countries
of origin of the necessary conflict minerals in its in-scope products. However, based on the information provided by VF&#146;s suppliers and the Service Provider, the following plausible potential countries of origin were identified to us:
Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the DRC, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Rwanda, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Suriname, Thailand, United Kingdom and
