regarding the Subject Minerals. This good faith RCOI was reasonably designed to determine whether any of the Subject Minerals originated in the Covered Countries and whether any of the Subject Minerals may be from recycled or scrap sources, in
accordance with Form SD and related guidance provided by the SEC. The Company also exercised due diligence on the source of the Subject Minerals. The Company&#146;s due diligence measures have been designed to follow the framework in the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas: Second Edition, including the related supplements on gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten
(the &#147;<B><I>OECD Guidelines</I></B>&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RCOI </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s global supply chain is complex. In the course of its business operations, the Company may purchase materials and components
containing conflict minerals. These materials and components may, in turn, be included in the Company&#146;s products. Because the Company does not purchase conflict minerals directly from mines, smelters or refiners, there are many third parties in
the supply chain between the Company and the original sources of conflict minerals. As a result, the Company relies on its direct material suppliers to provide information regarding the origin of any conflict minerals that are included in its
products. In accordance with the OECD Guidelines and related guidance provided by the SEC, the Company works with its direct material suppliers to identify, where possible, the smelters and/or refiners and countries of origin of the Subject
Minerals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the Reporting Period, the Company continued to identify direct material suppliers that it believed could potentially
provide materials or components containing Subject Minerals (collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Covered Suppliers</I></B>&#148;). During the Reporting Period, the Company maintained the certain questions regarding conflict minerals in its existing
web-based supplier portal, which the Company refers to as &#147;PHconnect,&#148; to determine whether each such Covered Supplier was supplying materials or components to the Company that contained Subject Minerals and, if so, to determine the source
of such Subject Minerals. The Company&#146;s PHconnect system requires suppliers to, among other matters, confirm the source of any conflict minerals contained in materials or components supplied to the Company and to provide annual updates
regarding such responses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Given the size and complexity of the Company&#146;s global supply chain, the Company focused on its largest
suppliers, ranked by the amount the Company spends with each such supplier, and suppliers that had the highest probability of supplying the Company with materials or components containing Subject Minerals (<I>e.g.</I>, electronics). An escalation
process was initiated with Covered Suppliers who continued to be non-responsive after the above contacts were made, or whose initial (or subsequent) response was not complete or otherwise warranted clarification or confirmation. Using a risk-based
approach, the Company evaluated responses from the Covered Suppliers for plausibility, consistency, and gaps both in terms of which materials or components were stated to contain or not contain Subject Minerals, as well as the origin of those
Subject Minerals. The Company engaged certain Covered Suppliers, holding discussions and reviewing the results of their internal due diligence efforts, to ensure that the Company&#146;s inquiries regarding conflict minerals were understood and
complied with. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the Reporting Period, the Company obtained representations from suppliers representing approximately 83% of its total
direct material spend during the Reporting Period, up from 70% during the period from January 2013 through December 2013. Such representations included, from certain Covered Suppliers, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Conflict-Free</FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company maintains an internal team to manage conflict minerals engagement with its suppliers. During the Reporting Period, the Company
held meetings with senior members of the Company&#146;s law department, supply chain management department and environmental/health/safety department to educate the Company&#146;s procurement, sales and compliance personnel on the SEC&#146;s rules
regarding conflict minerals and to ensure the timely implementation of the Company&#146;s conflict minerals programs. This center-led team of subject matter experts is responsible for working with the Company&#146;s employees to provide training and
guidance, implement reporting systems and facilitate communication between departments with respect to compliance with the SEC&#146;s reporting requirements regarding conflict minerals. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s conflict minerals reporting compliance measures are managed at the division level where the supplier relationship exists.
Each division is responsible for managing the conflict minerals, if any, provided by its supply base and for identifying, where possible, the supplier of such conflict minerals in the Company&#146;s materials or components. Using PHconnect, the
Company engages suppliers of conflict minerals, communicates its reporting obligations with respect to conflict minerals and follows up with such suppliers to ensure ongoing compliance. During the Reporting Period, the Company also:
(i)&nbsp;continued to educate key employees regarding conflict minerals; (ii)&nbsp;continued to respond to questions from the Company&#146;s supplier base regarding conflict minerals; and (iii)&nbsp;maintained its internal training for responses to
questions from the Company&#146;s customers regarding conflict minerals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Identify and Assess Risks in the Supply Chain </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed above, the Company continues to assess its supply chain risks and work with its suppliers in developing greater supply chain
transparency. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Implement Additional Terms and Conditions and Supplier Code of Conduct </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the Reporting Period, the Company strengthened its commitment to the responsible sourcing of conflict minerals though the implementation
of specific terms and conditions in certain supply agreements and purchase orders. These additional terms and conditions require, among other matters, that no materials or components supplied under such contract may contain any conflict minerals
that directly or indirectly finance any armed group that has been identified as a perpetrator of human rights abuses. These new terms and conditions are included in all new or renewed contracts. In addition, during the Reporting Period the Company
amended its supplier code of conduct to prohibit suppliers from supplying the Company with certain conflict minerals originating in the Covered Countries. This amended supplier code of conduct is accessed by suppliers through the Company&#146;s
PHconnect system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Design and Implement a Strategy to Respond to Identified Risks </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate responsibility through its compliance with Form SD. As required by Form SD,
the Company is reporting the findings of its RCOI and additional due diligence measures through the preparation of this Report. The Company&#146;s internal team that manages conflict minerals engagement with the Company&#146;s suppliers also works

they arise. For example, as noted above, the Company conducted additional due diligence for certain Covered Suppliers who provided inadequate or incomplete initial responses to the Company&#146;s
RCOI. The Company uses its PHconnect system to monitor the use of conflict minerals in its supply chain. Data from the PHconnect system is used at the corporate, group and division levels to oversee the Company&#146;s supplier base and to provide
key metrics to decision makers to assist with the Company&#146;s conflict minerals reporting compliance and to provide meaningful comparisons regarding supply chain transparency across the Company. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where possible, the Company has relied on third party assurances and certifications. For example, the Company accepts as reliable any smelter

from certain Covered Suppliers in connection with its RCOI that listed smelter or refiner names, such Covered Suppliers were unable to accurately report which specific smelters were part of the supply chain for the Subject Minerals. For example, the
majority of Covered Suppliers reported their sourcing results on a company-wide basis, rather than on a product-specific basis or were unable to determine the facility/smelter and/or country of origin for the Subject Minerals. A Covered
Supplier&#146;s failure to identify a specific facility/smelter and/or country of origin at any point in its supply chain will drive an equivalent response for the Company and, therefore, the Company is unable to report any known facilities/smelters
and/or countries of origin for the Subject Minerals at this time. The Company continues to implement and refine its conflict minerals program to improve its supply chain transparency by obtaining more accurate and more complete information from its
