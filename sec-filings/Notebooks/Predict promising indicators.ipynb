Obtaining information regarding smelters, refiners and mine location is therefore challenging.\\n\\xa0\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 3M\\x92s Conflict Minerals Policy: As disclosed in our Form\\xa0SD filed on June\\xa02, 2014, 3M adopted a Conflict Minerals Policy (\\x93Policy\\x94) in July, 2011.\\xa0 The Policy applies to all 3M suppliers.\\xa0 It was updated in November\\xa02012 following the SEC\\x92s adoption of the final conflict minerals rule\\xa0(\\x93Final Rule\\x94), and is available on our website along with other information on 3M\\x92s conflict minerals program.\\xa0\\xa0 3M expects its suppliers to: (a)\\xa0supply materials that are \\x93DRC conflict free\\x94; (b)\\xa0adopt a conflict minerals policy consistent with 3M\\x92s; (c)\\xa0implement management systems to support compliance with their conflict minerals policy; and (d)\\xa0require their suppliers to take the same steps.\\n\\xa0\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 3M\\x92s Commitment to Industry Participation in the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI): As a downstream company that does not typically contract directly with 3TG smelters or refiners, 3M actively collaborated with others in the industry through participation in the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI), which evolved from the Electronic Industry \\n\\xa0\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nCitizenship Coalition-Global e-Sustainability Initiative (EICC-GeSI).\\xa0 The CFSI is a broad-based initiative to develop control systems regarding smelters and refiners through independently validated audits under CFSI\\x92s Conflict Free Smelter (CFS) program.\\xa0 Over 200 companies and associations across seven different industries participate in the CFSI.\\xa0 In furtherance of our commitment to industry collaborative controls and the CFS program in particular, in January\\xa02014 3M made a donation to the CFSI Initial Audit Fund to provide financial assistance to smelters for their first-year audit.\\xa0 The Fund is intended to eliminate barriers to smelter participation in the CFS program.\\xa0 In addition, 3M was a member of CFSI throughout 2014.\\xa0 In 2014 we encouraged supplier and other company membership and participation in CFSI.\\n\\xa0\\nB.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Description of RCOI:\\n\\xa0\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 RCOI Elements:\\xa0 The elements of 3M\\x92s RCOI were identification and prioritization of suppliers, supplier data collection and an assessment of supplier data to determine whether further due diligence was required.\\xa0 These basic elements did not change from the previous year\\x92s inquiry.\\n\\xa0\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Prioritized Supplier Inquiry:\\xa0 In view of 3M\\x92s extensive supply chains, 3M determined that a reasonably designed and good faith inquiry should focus on higher priority suppliers consistent with the Conflict Free Smelter Initiative (CFSI) Reasonable Practices Guidance (subsequently renamed Five Practical Steps to Support SEC Conflict Minerals Disclosure).\\xa0 3M designated over 50 employees globally as \\x93Conflict Minerals Advisors\\x94 (CMAs).\\xa0 The CMAs and many other knowledgeable 3M personnel identified products containing 3TG necessary to the functionality or production of those products (\\x93Necessary 3TG\\x94).\\xa0 This process resulted in many product families and individual products being screened out from further inquiry, as not containing Necessary 3TG.\\xa0 3M then prioritized its review of those products containing Necessary 3TG and the corresponding supply chains taking into account various factors such as estimated content of 3TG, type of mineral, amount of spend, the nature of the supply chain, and supplier location.\\n\\xa0\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Data Collection Via Web-Enabled Supplier Inquiry:\\xa0 \\xa0Once the relevant higher priority suppliers (\\x93Supplier Group\\x94) were identified, 3M asked the Supplier Group to provide information about the Necessary 3TG in their products based on the industry standard CFSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), formerly known as the EICC-GeSI CFSI reporting template.\\xa0 This request was web-enabled using 3M\\x92s Supplier Regulatory eEnablement (SREE) system.\\xa0 That system issued three automatic follow-up reminders to those in the Supplier Group who had not responded to the information request.\\xa0 Additional e-mail reminders were sent to those in the Supplier Group who had not responded, and follow-up phone calls were made with prioritized suppliers.\\n\\xa0\\nC.\\xa0 Results of RCOI\\n\\xa0\\nDownstream companies such as 3M are not likely to have direct information on the sources of minerals upstream of the smelters or refiners (SORs) in their supply chains.\\xa0 Instead, downstream companies rely on available information regarding SORs identified through supplier inquiry.\\xa0 Accordingly, 3M reviewed supplier responses resulting from the inquiry described in Paragraph B.3 above as well as information from capacity-building interactions and efforts with suppliers to \\n\\xa0\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nelicit responses and encourage development of conflict minerals programs.\\xa0 These supplier responses and our capacity-building efforts affirmed information on supply chain maturity gathered through participation in the CFSI program and other industry associations. Although 3M received more SOR names from the Supplier Group for the 2014 reporting year as compared to those received from the Supplier Group for the 2013 reporting year, which indicated progress, the multi-tiered supply chains were still building capacity to pass 3TG-related inquiries and information on SORs up and down those supply chains.\\xa0 As a downstream company typically several tiers from SORs, 3M relied on information from direct suppliers, many of them smaller and private companies.\\xa0 These direct suppliers were continuing to build their conflict minerals programs and capacities to transmit conflict mineral information during 2014.\\n\\xa0\\nD.\\xa0 Conclusion\\n\\xa0\\nBased on its RCOI 3M has reason to believe that a portion of its Necessary 3TG may have originated in the Covered Countries and has reason to believe that those Necessary 3TG may not be from recycled or scrap sources.\\xa0 Accordingly, 3M conducted further due diligence on the source and chain of custody of Necessary 3TG contained in products supplied by the Supplier Group.\\xa0 After conducting the due diligence described in the attached Conflict Minerals Report, 3M determined that based on SOR information provided by the Supplier Group and information available to 3M as a member of CFSI, the SORs identified as sourcing from those Covered Countries have all been validated as using conflict free sourcing practices under the Conflict Free Smelter program.\\n\\xa0\\nIn accord with Rule\\xa013p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 3M has filed this Specialized Disclosure Form\\xa0(Form\\xa0SD) and\\xa0the associated Conflict Minerals Report and both reports are posted to a publicly available Internet site at http://investors.3m.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx and are listed under the filing type \\x93SD.\\x94 The reference to 3M\\x92s website is provided for convenience only, and its contents are not incorporated by reference into this Form\\xa0SD and Conflict Minerals Report nor deemed filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\xa0\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nItem 1.02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Exhibit\\n\\xa0\\nThe Conflict Minerals Report required by Item 1.01 is filed as Exhibit\\xa01.01 to this Form\\xa0SD.\\n\\xa0\\nSection\\xa02 \\x97 Exhibits\\n\\xa0\\nItem\\xa0\\xa0 2.01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Exhibits\\n\\xa0\\nExhibit\\xa01.01 \\x96 Conflict Minerals Report for the period January\\xa01 to December\\xa031, 2014, as required by Items 1.01 and 1.02 of this Form\\n\\xa0\\nSIGNATURES\\n\\xa0\\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the duly authorized undersigned.\\n\\xa0\\n3M COMPANY\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/s/ Paul A.
