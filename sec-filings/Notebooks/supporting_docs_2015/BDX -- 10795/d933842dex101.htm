has included this Conflict Minerals Report as an exhibit to its Form SD for 2014, as required by Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Form SD (collectively, the &#147;Conflict Minerals Rule&#148;). The date of filing
of this Conflict Minerals Report is May&nbsp;29, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term &#147;BD,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148;
and &#147;our&#148; refer to Becton, Dickinson and Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for 2014. As used herein and consistent with the Conflict Minerals Rule, &#147;Conflict Minerals&#148; are columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold,
wolframite and the derivatives tantalum, tin, and tungsten, without regard to the location of origin of the minerals or derivative metals. The &#147;Conflict Affected Region&#148; is defined as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its adjacent
countries, which include Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, The Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BD is a leading medical technology company that
partners with customers and stakeholders to address many of the world&#146;s most pressing and evolving health needs. Our innovative solutions are focused on improving medication management and patient safety; supporting infection prevention
practices; equipping surgical and interventional procedures; improving drug delivery; aiding anesthesiology and respiratory care; advancing cellular research and applications; enhancing the diagnosis of infectious diseases and cancers; and
supporting the management of diabetes. In 2015, BD acquired CareFusion Corporation. CareFusion is not discussed in this Conflict Minerals Report because the acquisition occurred after the reporting period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BD is subject to the Conflict Minerals Rule because, for 2014, certain of the raw materials and components contained in some of the products that we
manufactured or contracted to manufacture contained Conflict Minerals that were necessary to the functionality or production of the products. Many of our products do not contain any Conflict Minerals or are otherwise not in-scope for purposes of our
Conflict Minerals Rule compliance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not directly source Conflict Minerals from mines, smelters, or refiners, and we believe that we are many levels
removed from these market participants and, therefore, have limited influence over their behavior. Furthermore, because of the depth, geographic diversity, and constant evolution of our supply chain, and due to competitive factors, we often have
significant difficulty identifying market participants upstream from our direct suppliers. However, through the efforts described in this Conflict Minerals Report, we seek to ensure that our sourcing practices are consistent with our Conflict
Minerals Policy, which is described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Conflict Minerals Policy </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BD expects its suppliers and subcontractors to source responsibly, respect human rights, and not contribute to conflict. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Without limiting the foregoing, BD expects that its suppliers and subcontractors will not knowingly source Conflict Minerals from sources that directly or
indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Conflict Affected Region. In furtherance of this expectation and BD&#146;s obligations under the Conflict Minerals Rule, applicable BD suppliers and subcontractors (as defined by BD) will be expected
to complete a declaration concerning the usage and source of any Conflict Minerals in the products supplied to us. As part of gathering the information for the declaration, applicable BD suppliers and subcontractors will be expected to conduct a
reasonable country of origin inquiry and/or due diligence, as applicable, in accordance with the Conflict Minerals Rule and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#146;s Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of
Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (the &#147;OECD Guidance&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In cases where suppliers or subcontractors are found to not be in
compliance with our policy, we intend to work with and encourage them to source responsibly. Where these efforts fail or we believe that further engagement with a supplier or subcontractor is inappropriate, we will re-evaluate our business
relationship. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As required by the Conflict Minerals Rule, for 2014, we conducted a &#147;reasonable country of origin inquiry.&#148; Our outreach included 1,794 suppliers
(the &#147;Suppliers&#148;) that we identified through our internal scoping process as having provided, or that we believe may have provided, us with raw materials or components that contain Conflict Minerals. As part of our materials review
process, technical personnel within each of our business units reviewed raw materials newly added in 2014 that were used at our manufacturing sites to identify the potential presence of Conflict Minerals. Participating personnel in our scoping
process included personnel from Global Procurement, Manufacturing, Operations and Research and Development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Smelter and Refiner Information </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For 2014, our Suppliers identified to us the smelters and refiners described in the table below as potentially having processed the necessary Conflict Minerals
contained in our in-scope products. We were able to determine the origin of only a portion (if any) of the necessary Conflict Minerals contained in each of our in-scope products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Not all of the facilities described in the table below may have processed the necessary Conflict Minerals contained in our in-scope products. Many suppliers
reported information to us at a &#147;company&#148; level (meaning that they reported all of the smelters and refiners that may have processed the Conflict Minerals contained in all of their products, not just those pertaining to the products sold
to us). They also may have reported to us smelters and refiners that were not in our supply chain due to over-inclusiveness in the information received from their suppliers or for other reasons. Furthermore, the smelters and refiners described below
may not be all of the smelters and refiners in our supply chain, since the Suppliers did not identify all of the smelters and refiners in their supply chains and because we did not receive responses from all of the Suppliers. Due to our position in
the supply chain, we rely on our suppliers for accurate smelter and refiner information and our reasonable country of origin inquiry and due diligence measures do not provide absolute certainty regarding the source of the necessary Conflict Minerals
contained in our in-scope products. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

for certain errors and inaccuracies and follow up with these suppliers as well. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Smelter and refiner information provided by suppliers is reviewed against
the Standard Smelter Names tab of the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template and the list of known processing facilities on the Commerce Department List. To the extent that a smelter or refiner identified by a supplier is not on either of these lists,
we take additional steps to attempt to determine whether the listed entity is a smelter or refiner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Smelter and refiner information is also reviewed
against the lists of &#147;compliant&#148; and &#147;active&#148; smelters and refiners and country of origin information published by the CFSI. To the extent that a smelter or refiner identified by a supplier is not listed as compliant by the CFSI,
we consult publicly available information to attempt to determine whether the smelter or refiner obtained Conflict Minerals from sources that directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed groups in the Conflict Affected Region. </P>

appropriate mitigation strategy for any identified non-compliance with our Conflict Minerals Policy and other supplier requirements and expectations relating to Conflict Minerals compliance. Potential outcomes under our mitigation strategy include
continuing to work with the supplier while non-compliances are addressed, or suspending or terminating the relationship with the supplier. Under our mitigation strategy, to the extent that areas of non-compliance that require mitigation are
identified, we monitor and track the performance of the mitigation efforts and report back to appropriate senior oversight personnel. Under our procedures, we also will undertake additional fact and risk assessments, as determined by the Steering
Team, for non-compliances that require mitigation or after a change of circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Carry out Independent Third-party Audit of Supply Chain Due
