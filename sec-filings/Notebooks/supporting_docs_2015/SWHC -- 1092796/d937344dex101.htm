Smith&nbsp;&amp; Wesson Holding Corporation (&#147;<B>SWHC</B>,&#148; &#147;<B>Company</B>,&#148; &#147;<B>we</B>,&#148; or &#147;<B>our</B>&#148;) is provided for the reporting period January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2014, and is presented
to comply with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;<B>Rule</B>&#148;), and the Public Statement on the Effect of the Recent Court of Appeals Decision on the Conflict Minerals Rule issued by the Director of the Division of
Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission on April&nbsp;29, 2014 (the &#147;<B>SEC Statement</B>&#148;). This Rule was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<B>SEC</B>&#148;) to implement reporting and
disclosure requirements related to conflict minerals as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;<B>Dodd-Frank Act</B>&#148;). The Rule imposes certain reporting obligations on SEC registrants whose
manufactured products contain tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (&#147;<B>3TG</B>,&#148; also defined by the rule as &#147;conflict minerals&#148;), and who have reason to believe that the products they manufacture, or contract to manufacture,
contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of those products. If the SEC registrant has reason to believe that any conflict minerals may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining
country, or is unable to determine the country of origin of those conflict minerals, the SEC registrant is required to submit a Conflict Minerals Report to the SEC that includes a description of the measures it took to exercise due diligence on the
conflict minerals&#146; source and chain of custody. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>COMPANY BACKGROUND </B></P>

conflict minerals status of any conflict minerals used in its products. In conducting its due diligence, SWHC implemented the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (including the Supplements on Tin, Tantalum and Tungsten, and the Gold Supplement) (Second Edition OECD 2013) (&#147;<B>OECD Guidance</B>&#148;), an internationally recognized due diligence framework. </P>

the names of the smelters identified by our suppliers to those identified as compliant in the CFSP. The CFSP uses independent private sector auditors to audit the source, including mines of origin, and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used
by smelters and refiners that agree to participate in the CFSP. The smelters and refiners that are found to be CFSP compliant are those for which the independent auditor has verified that the smelter&#146;s or refiner&#146;s conflict minerals
originated from conflict free mines and trading in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or any of its adjoining countries. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After conducting
