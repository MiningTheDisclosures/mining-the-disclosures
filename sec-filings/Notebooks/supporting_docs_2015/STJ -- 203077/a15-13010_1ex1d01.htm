<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">The Conflict Minerals Rule&nbsp;requires public companies to disclose whether the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture contain &#147;conflict minerals&#148; that are &#147;necessary to the functionality or production&#148; of those products.&#160; Conflict minerals refer to: (i)&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;columbite-tantalite or coltan, the metal ore from which tantalum is extracted, (b)&nbsp;cassiterite, the metal ore from which tin is extracted, (c)&nbsp;wolframite, the metal ore from which tungsten is extracted, and (d)&nbsp;gold (commonly referred to collectively as &#147;3TG&#148;); or (ii)&nbsp;any other mineral or its derivatives determined by the U.S. Secretary of State to be financing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the &#147;Covered Countries&#148;).</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">We designed our due diligence measures, which are described below, to conform, in all material respects, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the &#147;OECD&#148;) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and the related Supplements (the &#147;OECD Guidance&#148;).</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">Beginning in 2013, St. Jude Medical initiated a comprehensive process to comply with the Conflict Minerals Rule&nbsp;and took steps to establish in our supply chain due diligence measures and internal controls with respect to 3TG minerals.&#160; In 2014 we maintained our interdisciplinary, cross-functional team and continued to provide management support and resources to that team, to implement our ongoing compliance efforts.&#160; Our supply chain due diligence process is based on the due diligence tools developed by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (&#147;CFSI&#148;), including a supplier survey using the CFSI&#146;s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (the &#147;Template&#148;), which is designed to identify the smelters and refiners that process the conflict minerals in a company&#146;s supply chain. We also maintained a company-level grievance mechanism, through our Business Integrity HelpCenter, which enables employees and others to report concerns, including any concerns regarding our conflict minerals supply chain.</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">In May&nbsp;2014, we adopted a conflict minerals policy, which is publicly available on our website at <u>www.sjm.com</u>.&#160; This policy describes our commitment to supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing of 3TG minerals and our expectation that our suppliers implement conflict minerals compliance programs and provide us with declarations regarding the origin of the conflict minerals in the products and parts they supply to us.</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">As a &#147;downstream&#148; original equipment manufacturer (&#147;OEM&#148;), we have no direct relationships or contacts with mine operators or the smelters or refineries that process minerals which may ultimately be incorporated into St. Jude Medical&#146;s products.&#160; Similarly, St. Jude Medical is several tiers removed in the supply chain from mining and smelting activity.&#160; As a result, we must rely on our direct suppliers (&#147;Tier 1 suppliers&#148;) to provide us with information regarding the 3TG minerals contained in the products and materials they supply to us; and our Tier 1 suppliers, in turn, must rely on information provided to them by their suppliers.&#160; Accordingly, and consistent with OECD Guidance, we worked with our Tier 1 suppliers to obtain information on the origin and sourcing of any 3TG minerals contained in items that such Tier 1 suppliers sold to us.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">Our efforts to improve supply chain transparency and identify risks within our supply chain associated with 3TG minerals are ongoing.&#160; We continued to use a risk-based approach to evaluate responses from our Tier 1 suppliers for plausibility, consistency, and gaps, both in terms of which items were stated to contain or not contain 3TG minerals and the origin of those minerals.</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">Based on responses from the 2013 reporting period and additional review and analysis by our supply chain organization, we identified 394 Tier 1 suppliers, for the 2014 reporting period, who supplied products, components, assemblies or sub-assemblies that may contain 3TG minerals to St. Jude Medical, and initiated a supply chain survey process with respect to such minerals.&#160; We provided each of these Tier 1 suppliers with an instructional letter along with the Template, which was developed to facilitate disclosure and communication of information regarding smelters and refineries that provide material into a company&#146;s supply chain.&#160; The survey includes questions regarding a company&#146;s conflict</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">Approximately 216 Tier 1 suppliers responded to our CFSI survey.&#160; We created a database to organize the information received through our Tier 1 suppliers&#146; survey responses and reviewed the responses for accuracy and completeness and assessed what steps the Tier 1 suppliers had undertaken to analyze their own supply chains and vendors with respect to the use and sourcing of 3TG minerals.&#160; We compared the list of smelters and refiners reported by Tier 1 suppliers against the list of designated conflict-free smelters and refiners published by the CFSI&#146;s Conflict-Free Smelter Program.&#160; In addition, we established an escalation process for, and sent follow up letters to, all previously identified Tier 1 suppliers who had not responded to the survey and also followed up with certain suppliers whose responses were unclear or incomplete through telephone interviews and email correspondence.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">Because we are a downstream OEM company with over 1,500 Tier 1 suppliers, and due to our relative location within the supply chain, several tiers removed from the extraction, transport and refinement of ore, it is difficult for us to trace minerals back to their country of origin.&#160; We continued to develop and execute processes to identify suppliers that potentially provide materials and components that contain 3TG minerals and to conduct due diligence on our supply chain, including a risk-based evaluation of our suppliers&#146; responses.&#160; We also continued our supplier communications and outreach to improve the quality and accuracy of information from our Tier 1 suppliers.&#160; In addition, we have begun incorporating contractual requirements relating to conflict minerals reporting and compliance into our supply chain contracts and terms and conditions.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:11.0pt;">We intend to take the following steps with respect to our due diligence to further mitigate the risk that the 3TG minerals in our products could benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries: (i)&nbsp;continue to assess our product portfolio for potential inclusion of 3TG minerals and conduct good faith RCOI and related due diligence with respect to those products; (ii)&nbsp;integrate any new Tier 1 suppliers that enter St. Jude Medical&#146;s supply chain into our RCOI and due diligence process; (iii)&nbsp;continue to engage with our Tier 1 suppliers concerning due diligence and reporting obligations with respect to conflict minerals and provide them with or refer them to educational materials and resources; (iv)&nbsp;continue to engage with suppliers that provided incomplete or uncertain information or that did not respond to the supplier survey; and (v)&nbsp;continue to compare the list of smelters identified through our good faith RCOI and related due diligence process to the evolving lists of smelters who have been designated as &#147;conflict free&#148; through independent &#147;conflict free&#148; smelter designation programs and encourage our suppliers to implement measures in their supply chains to use validated conflict-free smelters.</font></p>
