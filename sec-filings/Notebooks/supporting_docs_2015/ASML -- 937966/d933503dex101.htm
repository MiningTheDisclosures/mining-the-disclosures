<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In an effort to curb the violence and exploitation occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (&#147;DRC&#148;) and adjoining regions, the Securities
and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) adopted rules pursuant to Section&nbsp;1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). Section&nbsp;1502 of the legislation addresses conflict minerals
and requires companies to publicly disclose information related to the use in their products of minerals originating in the DRC and the countries adjoining the DRC (&#147;Covered Countries&#148;), including the Central African Republic, South Sudan,
Zambia, Angola, The Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. The minerals currently subject to SEC&#146;s disclosure requirements, referred to as &#147;conflict minerals,&#148; are columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite,
wolframite and gold, and their derivatives, including tin, tantalum and tungsten (&#147;3TG&#148;). This Conflict Minerals Report is filed pursuant to Section&nbsp;1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not obtained an independent private sector audit of this Conflict Minerals Report. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Business Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ASML designs, develops, integrates,
markets and services advanced lithography systems used by our customers&#151;the major global integrated circuit manufacturers&#151;to create chips that power a wide array of electronic, communication, and information technology products. Our
product development strategy focuses on the development of product families based on a modular, upgradeable design. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our older PAS 2500 and PAS 5000
lithography systems, which we no longer manufacture but continue to refurbish, are used with g-line and i-line light sources for processing wafers up to 150 mm in diameter and are employed in manufacturing environments and in special applications
for which semiconductor design resolutions of 0.5 microns and above are required. Our PAS 5500 product family comprises advanced wafer steppers and Step-and-Scan systems equipped with i-line, KrF and ArF light sources for processing wafers up to 200
mm in diameter and are employed in volume manufacturing to achieve semiconductor design nodes requiring imaging at a resolution down to 90 nm. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The modular upgradeable design philosophy of the PAS 5500 product family has been further refined and applied in
the design of our TWINSCAN systems, which are the basis of our current and next-generation Step-and-Scan systems. TWINSCAN systems are equipped with i-line, KrF and ArF light sources for processing wafers up to 300 mm in diameter and are capable of
extending semiconductor shrink technology down to 38 nm and beyond with multiple patterning techniques. The dual-stage advantage of TWINSCAN immersion systems enables our customers to benefit from the process enhancement of immersion while
continuing to use familiar and proven technology. ASML&#146;s TWINSCAN NXE platform is the industry&#146;s first production platform for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), currently offering 22 nm resolution with conventional illumination and
18 nm with off-axis illumination as well as improved overlay and higher productivity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we continuously develop and sell a range of product
options and enhancements, including the YIELDSTAR system, designed to increase semiconductor manufacturing productivity and improve imaging and overlay to optimize value of ownership over the entire lifecycle of our systems. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The above described products involve the use of 3TG minerals, which are necessary to the functionality and production of our products. For example, gold is
used in coating critical electronic connectors to enhance connectivity performance, totaling approximately 250 grams per TWINSCAN system. Each TWINSCAN system also contains approximately 1,500 grams of tin, used for welding electronic components on
printed circuit boards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All 3TG minerals included in our systems are sourced as prefabricated component parts. ASML does not directly source 3TG minerals
as raw material. As a result, we are only able to determine whether the 3TG minerals included in our systems are derived from a Covered Country through information provided to us by our suppliers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ASML&#146;s
reasonable country of origin inquiry (&#147;RCOI&#148;) was designed to determine whether any of the minerals that are necessary to the functionality and production of our products may have originated from the Covered Countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our RCOI primarily consisted of conducting a supply-chain survey using the reporting template provided by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition
(&#147;EICC&#148;) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (&#147;GeSI&#148;) (together, the &#147;EICC/GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template&#148;). ASML surveyed 55 first-tier product suppliers of which the purchased product parts are
likely to contain 3TG minerals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also utilized resources provided by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (&#147;CFSI&#148;), including the
Conflict-Free Smelter Program (&#147;CFSP&#148;). The CFSP uses a third party audit firm to identify smelters and refiners that have systems in place to assure sourcing of only conflict-free materials, to provide additional country of origin
information. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the RCOI, we have reason to believe that some of the 3TG minerals included in our systems are likely to have originated from the Covered
Countries. Therefore, we conducted supply chain due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals, in a manner consistent with the framework promulgated by the OECD and its <I>Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply
Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas</I> (&#147;OECD Guidance&#148;). In our efforts to adhere to the OECD Guidance, we have taken the following actions: </P>

minerals policy (the &#147;Conflict Minerals Policy&#148;) in 2013, committed to addressing the concern that certain minerals that are contained in our systems may contribute to the funding of military conflict and human rights violations in the
Covered Countries. Through this policy, we have encouraged our suppliers and sub-suppliers to responsibly source conflict minerals and their derivatives. This policy statement is available online at www.asml.com </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Launched The ASML Conflict Minerals Project </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To ensure
compliance with the Conflict Minerals Policy, in 2013 we designed and implemented the ASML conflict minerals project (the &#147;Project&#148;), which established internal management systems to support the newly-created conflict minerals project team
(the &#147;Project Team&#148;) in conducting due diligence in tracing the supply chain of conflict minerals in 2013. The Project Team continued its activities for the year 2014. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Employment of a Risk-Based Strategic Approach </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Project Team utilized a risk-based, phase-in strategic approach towards supplier awareness and due diligence, the full execution of which we estimate will
take a few years. Our risk-based phase-in approach focuses on introducing our suppliers to our expectations with respect to conflict minerals and conducting supply chain due diligence with selected first-tier product suppliers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We examined our products, mineral usage, and direct spending volumes in 2012 to select those suppliers that provide us with the product parts most likely to
contain tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold. This resulted in a targeted supplier population of 57 for the 2013 reporting. We surveyed 55 suppliers for the 2014 reporting. </P>

conflict minerals under Section&nbsp;1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act and Form SD and referred suppliers to ASML Conflict Minerals Policy and additional information that described our approach to creating a sustainable supply chain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in order to further prepare our suppliers, we published the Conflict Minerals Policy on ASML&#146;s website for suppliers for their reference.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Conflict Minerals Policy, due diligence approach, and supplier expectations have been conveyed to our supply chain via e-mail correspondence and
frequently asked questions (&#147;FAQ&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In an effort to encourage supplier compliance, we distributed a set of FAQs in a follow-up letter to our
suppliers in scope of this survey. We also elected to share the FAQs with our non-supplier peers to assist other companies in their compliance efforts. We held special information sessions as needed with individual first-tier suppliers upon their
request to foster awareness and greater understanding. We believe these sessions provided our suppliers with the necessary tools to enable them to trace their supply chains down to the smelter level. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In an effort to further encourage supplier compliance, ASML works in collaboration with several other technology OEM&#146;s in the region of Eindhoven to
enlarge the pressure towards suppliers to implement conflict-free smelter programs such as the CFSI. Because the supplier-list of these OEMs is almost identical, these OEMs and local SME&#146;s joined forces in Brainport Development encouraging
shared suppliers to utilize a conflict-minerals policy that attempts to map and trace the supply chain back to the smelter. Brainport Development works toward greater industry awareness by sharing supply-chain traceability information. Brainport
Development is a group of OEMs and SMEs from the region around Eindhoven in The Netherlands that also aims to strengthen the professional character and competitive position of the high-tech supply chain in the region. </P>

quality by verifying information accuracy and checking for inconsistencies. To ensure accuracy of the information provided, the Project Team compared the smelters and refiners identified by our direct suppliers against the list of smelter facilities
identified and/or designated as &#147;conflict free&#148; under the EICC and the CFSP&#146;s lists for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold smelters. Any identified inconsistencies or inaccuracies were brought to the relevant suppliers&#146; attention

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of our active participation in the Brainport Development program, individual follow-up on suppliers survey results and sharing of FAQs, we are able to
report a response rate of 98% of the 55 suppliers that were surveyed in 2014. Based on detailed assessment of the reports returned, we believe that the quality of the reports can still be improved. A majority of the suppliers surveyed are not able
to map and trace their supply chains back to the smelters used or to otherwise identify smelters supplying 3TG minerals. We will bring this fact back to the relevant suppliers&#146; attention. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Encouraged the success of the Conflict Free Smelter Program </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To aid in the industry-wide concerns regarding conflict minerals, in addition to working with our own suppliers, we are also participating in initiatives led
by the EICC and GeSI. In 2013, ASML became a full member of the EICC. These organizations support information sharing on suppliers, including the identification and conflict-free status of 3TG smelters and refiners. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our membership and our participation in both the EICC and the CFSI, we continue to support the development of the CFSP, which aims for certification
of smelters and promotion of responsible sourcing from the Covered Countries, such that the legitimate miners involved those countries do not suffer. Since the start of the CFSI, members of the Project Team have regularly attended the various CFSI
Workshops organized by the EICC, focusing on in-region traceability and certification programs, practical aspects of conflict minerals legislation and reporting, and compliance best practices. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of February 2015, the CFSI verified the identities of 297 smelters world-wide, approximately 143 of which are
certified. As a result of our due diligence efforts, we can report that we have identified over 278 legitimate smelters verified by the CFSI within our supply chain, 141 of which are certified as &#147;DRC Conflict-Free.&#148; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of the suppliers surveyed, delivered a declaration in the CMRT format, including a list of smelters they could identify. As a result of the
examination, however, we can report, that the quality of the declarations can still be improved. For example, we have noticed inconsistencies in several suppliers&#146; declarations between the smelter information provided and information provided
by the CFSP on those smelters. These inconsistencies will be brought to the relevant suppliers&#146; attention. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Due Diligence Results </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the incomplete nature of the data available from our supply chain, a direct result of the 3TG supply chain complexity and the limited number of
certified conflict free smelters for all conflict minerals, we are unable to determine the precise origin of many of the 3TG minerals included in our products. </P>
