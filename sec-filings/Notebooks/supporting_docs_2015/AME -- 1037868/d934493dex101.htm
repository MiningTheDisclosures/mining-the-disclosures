MINERALS REPORT </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>For the Year Ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This report for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 is presented to comply with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#147;Rule
13p-1&#148;). For the purpose of the required Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (&#147;RCOI&#148;), AMETEK, Inc. (&#147;AMETEK&#148;) continued to receive supply chain responses through May&nbsp;28, 2015. Rule 13p-1 was adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to conflict minerals as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, HR 4173, Section&nbsp;1502 of 2010
(&#147;Conflict Minerals Act&#148;). Rule 13p-1 imposes certain reporting obligations on SEC registrants whose manufactured products contain conflict minerals which are necessary to the functionality or production of their products. Conflict
minerals are defined as cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite, and their derivatives, which are limited to tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold for the purposes of this assessment. These requirements apply to registrants whatever the
geographic origin of the conflict minerals and whether or not they fund armed conflict. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This Report has not been subject to an independent private sector
audit as allowed under Rule 13p-1, which provides a temporary accommodation for the first two years following November&nbsp;13, 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AMETEK&#146;s due
diligence approach has been to define our conflict-free minerals (&#147;CFM&#148;) process, establish baseline metrics and demonstrate improvements in supplier transparency and reporting over time. AMETEK&#146;s due diligence measures were based on
the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (&#147;EICC<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>&#148;) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (&#147;GeSI&#148;) with
the smelters and refiners of conflict minerals who provide those conflict minerals to our suppliers. EICC<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>/GeSI created the standard Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (&#147;Template&#148;)
as a common means for the collection of sourcing information related to &#147;conflict mineral&#148; from the supply base. This Template is consistent with EICC<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and GeSI&#146;s related
activities including the Conflict Free Smelter (&#147;CFS&#148;) Program and AMETEK has adopted it as an element of our due diligence program used to actively solicit CFM statuses from our supply base. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CFM process includes identification of items and suppliers that are exempt from the regulation, collection of supplier contact information and
distributing a request to the suppliers for completion of the Template. Upon receipt of the Template, a repository of the CFM status is updated and the supplier responses are archived. AMETEK is committed to continuing to work with our suppliers to
confirm that their supply of materials do not contain conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (&#147;DRC&#148;) or adjoining countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have completed changes to the Terms and Conditions of our purchase orders such that our suppliers are required to 1) disclose their CFM status on a yearly
basis or as requested and 2) provide immediate notification when there is a change in status. AMETEK&#146;s focus continues to be in obtaining completed Templates from our supplier base to increase the response rate for the next reporting period
with the goal of achieving conflict free minerals status. To date, we have received Conflict Mineral Status updates for more than 90% of our total annual spend. To the best of our knowledge all direct suppliers of one or more of the four CFM
elements have been certified as Conflict-Free or are currently being re-certified. The overwhelming majority of suppliers with unknown CFM statuses have declared they are not subject to the Dodd-Frank Act as 1) foreign entities not subject to the
SEC ruling, 2) distributors exempt from the Act, or 3) small revenue companies taking advantage of the additional 2-year grace period for usage of the Undeterminable CFM status. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AMETEK has determined in good faith that for calendar year 2014, its conflict minerals status as &#147;DRC
conflict undeterminable&#148; (as defined in the 1934 Act). As such, AMETEK is unable to determine whether or not any of their products originate in the DRC or an adjoining country. </P>
