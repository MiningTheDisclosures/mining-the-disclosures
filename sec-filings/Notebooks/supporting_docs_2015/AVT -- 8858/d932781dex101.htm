</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This is the Conflict Minerals Report of Avnet, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (herein referred to as &#147;Avnet&#148; or the
&#147;Company&#148;), for calendar year 2014 in accordance with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Rule&#148;). Conflict Minerals are defined as cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite, and their derivatives,
which are limited to tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (collectively &#147;3TG&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Avnet is a global value-added distributor of electronic
components, enterprise computer and storage products, IT solutions and services, and embedded subsystems. The Company creates a vital link in the technology supply chain that connects the world&#146;s leading electronic component and computer
product manufacturers and software developers with a global customer base of original equipment manufacturers, electronic manufacturing services providers, original design manufacturers, systems integrators, independent software vendors and
value-added resellers. The Company distributes electronic components, computer products and software, as received from its suppliers or through a customized solution, and offers assembly and other value-added services. In addition, the Company
provides engineering design, materials management and logistics services, system integration and configuration, and supply chain services customized to meet specific requirements of customers and suppliers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Conflict Minerals Policy </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company adopted a Conflicts
Minerals Policy, which provides, in part, that: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a global value-added distributor of electronic components, enterprise computer and
storage products, IT solutions and services, and embedded subsystems, Avnet promotes the traceability of these minerals and the transparency of the supply chain. Avnet firmly believes that its customers should be fully informed about the products
they purchase. While Avnet, as a distributor, is not able to certify as to the country of origin of the minerals contained in the products manufactured by Avnet&#146;s suppliers, Avnet is committed to working with its customers to supply products
that meet the customer&#146;s specifications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to those limited aspects of Avnet&#146;s business that manufacture or contract
to manufacture products that contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of the product, Avnet does not directly purchase any conflict minerals from any source and endeavors not to purchase products that contain
conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the [Democratic Republic of Congo] or adjoining countries. Avnet expects its suppliers to these aspects of its business to only source minerals from responsible sources
and provide Avnet with proper verification of the country of origin and source of the materials used in the products they supply to it. Avnet fully understands the importance of this issue to its customers and is committed to supply chain
initiatives and overall corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts that work towards a conflict free supply chain. Avnet is encouraging all of its suppliers to likewise support these efforts and make information on the origin of
their product components easily accessible on their websites. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Conflict Minerals Policy is available on the Company&#146;s website at
http://www.avnet.com/ under the &#147;Who we are &#150; Corporate Responsibility&#148; links. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Rule requires that the Company disclose in an annual Form SD and associated Conflict Minerals Report information regarding any 3TG that is &#147;necessary
to the functionality or production&#148; of any products that the Company manufactures or contracts to be manufactured. Further, the Rule requires that the Company conduct a reasonable country of origin investigation to determine whether any such
3TG originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or its adjoining countries (the &#147;Covered Countries&#148;) or is from recycled or scrap sources. If, based on the Company&#146;s reasonable country of origin inquiry, the Company knows that

Covered Countries and the Company has reason to believe that such 3TG may not be from recycled or scrap sources, the Company is required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of such 3TG that conforms to a nationally or
internationally recognized due diligence framework. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Design of the Company&#146;s Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry and Due Diligence Process

diligence phase, and (iii)&nbsp;reporting phase. The Company&#146;s program was designed to conform in all material respects to the framework in the <I>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas: Second Edition </I>(the &#147;OECD Framework&#148;). The Company&#146;s reasonable country of origin inquiry was designed such that it functioned as the first step of the
Company&#146;s due diligence measures. Consequently, the Company does not separately discuss its reasonable country of origin inquiry in the following discussion. </P>

its operations to determine which parts of its business, if any, may be subject to the disclosure requirements of the Rule. As provided by the Rule, this process did not include products that were not entered into the stream of commerce in the
calendar year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, or products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by entities acquired by the Company after April 2013. As a result of the process discussed in greater detail below, the Company determined that the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As noted in the Company&#146;s Conflict Minerals Policy, the Company does not purchase 3TG directly from any mine, refiner or smelter. The Company&#146;s
supply chain with respect to the Covered Products is highly complex and there are many parties in the supply chain between the Company&#146;s direct supplier and the mine from which the 3TG originated. Because of the Company&#146;s
&#147;downstream&#148; position in the supply chain, it followed the principles outlined in the OECD Framework for downstream companies with no direct relationships to smelters or refiners. In this context, &#147;downstream&#148; refers to the
supply chain from smelters and refiners to retailers; it includes companies such as the Company, as well as product and component manufacturers. In this regard, the Company must rely on its suppliers to provide information regarding the country of
origin and chain of custody of the 3TG included in the Covered Products. It is likely that years of engagement and propagation of expectations through many tiers of the supply chain will be necessary before information returned to downstream
companies, such as the Company, may be considered accurate and complete. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Due Diligence Efforts </B></P>
